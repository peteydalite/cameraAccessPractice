# cameraAccessPractice
practicing accessing media devices through the browser

Navigator.getUserMedia doesn't work will IOS devices but seems to work well with all others.
Used input tag with type="file" accept="video/*;capture=camcorder" to allow user to upload picture as a work around for it

Utilized Quagga.js for extracting barcode numbers from images
